# Design Patterns - Visitor

This repository showcases an implementation of the Visitor design pattern in C#. The code demonstrates how to separate operations from the objects on which they operate, enabling new operations to be added without altering the classes of the elements.

## Introduction
The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This pattern allows new operations to be added to existing object structures without modifying those structures, promoting the open/closed principle and enhancing code maintainability.

## Implementation Overview
This repository provides a C# implementation of the Visitor pattern. Key components of the code include:

- **IVisitor Interface**: Defines operations that can be performed on the elements.
- **IElement Interface**: Represents an element that can accept a visitor.
- **ConcreteElementA and ConcreteElementB Classes**: Implement the `IElement` interface and provide specific operations.
- **ConcreteVisitor Class**: Implements the `IVisitor` interface and defines operations for `ConcreteElementA` and `ConcreteElementB`.
- **Program Class**: Demonstrates how to use the pattern by creating elements and accepting the visitor.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DesignPattern-Visitor.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPattern-Visitor
```

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment to explore the implementation.

## Usage
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in your C# development environment.
2. Run the `Program` class to see the Visitor pattern in action.
3. Modify or extend the `ConcreteVisitor` or `ConcreteElement` classes to experiment with different visit operations.

### Example Output:
```
Visiting elements:
ConcreteVisitor: Visiting ConcreteElementA.
ConcreteElementA: OperationA() executed.
ConcreteVisitor: Visiting ConcreteElementB.
ConcreteElementB: OperationB() executed.
```
